Gentlemen, -

Having examined the Selections of Μ
L’ Homond‚ &1:- which you propose to publish,
I have no hesitation in recommending them
as the best elementary books I have ever met
with.

The. pure Latinity of the selections from
Sacred History‚ the interesting Historical and
Biographical Sketches of the othe1s‚ so excel-
lently calculated to excite and inform the ¹
youthful mind, together with the neatness and
accuracy of your editionS, will, Ι hope give '
them a speedy and general introduction into ,
our school&

. Wishing you that success which your un-
dertaking merite, I am,
Gentlemen‚ yourS, &czv
