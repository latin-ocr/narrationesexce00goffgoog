&Babylom A. C. 3:32. ”

(Ano. Hist. Q Our. book 5.)

Fnon the moment Alexanderhad finished so ter.-
rible a vengeance,bis²vast genius· suggests the pm·
ject off founding in Egypt a new Tyre, and of ma-
king· it as flourishing as {he ancient city had been, ·
either by its populatiom its* opulence, or its com-
merce. He calls his new city, after his own name,
Alexandria. ¹ ··

Free from all those cares which had suspended
his march against Dariu8„he-advances to the con-
test, which he begins in the plains of Arbela,² and
otiqtains a victory which secures to him-the empire '
0 Aflia. : ⁸ .

Whilst Darius is abandoned by his dearest fa·
ventites, wandering and fugitive, and near to ex-
pire, the victimof the villainous tieachery οΐΒιεεῑιε,
Alexander enters Babylon³ in triumph.

¹ Alexandria is situated upon one of the westem .
mont-hs of the Nile, near to the Mediterraneum Its ⁸
situation was so eligible, that whilst under the first -
successui-s of Alexander, it became the emporium
of the world and the centn-e of commerce. This
state of splendour lasted till the building of Cairo
by the Soudans. It ceased at last all at once, when
the Portuguese by the discovery of the Cape of
Good ssope. opened a new direction for commerce.
We see yet in this city the vestiges os its ancient

eatness.
gr, Arbela now called Erbel, is in Pereia and up·
on the frontiers of Asiatic ankey.
