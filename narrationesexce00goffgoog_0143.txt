Roman History, after the expulsion of their
KingS, presents nothing· but wat-s with theirneigh·
boux-s without, and troubles and divisions among·
themselves within. But when the Republic is me·

naced from abroad, the common danger, and the ,

public good, unite those who befofe were enemies.
Aided by these disturbant-ea, Herdonius, a rich
Sabine, had surprised the' capital and killed the
Consul. Valerius Quintius Cincinnatus is found
at bis plough and taken to succe-ed him. Some
time after, Μίηυῑὶιιε, one of his successore, suffers

his army to be surrounded by the Atqui, 1 from·
whom the appreffiension is so great as to cause the„ ‚
