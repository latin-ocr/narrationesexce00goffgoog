1112 a ,pasinful fact, that aima„ au the mmor
authors which are put into the hands of children to
give them a knowledge= of the Latin lang-uage, are
either simple in the extreme, or debasingjn thei&
tendenoy to the better affections of the beart, and
,subvermve of propriety of manners. ·

With s view to remedy the evils deplet-ed, 1 have
introduced into my Seminary, Mr. L’Homond’s
‘z‘ Epitome Historiae Sacroe,’' as every way calcula?-
ted to instruct child‘ren in Latin, anch-at the same
time to convey to their ‹mdes-standing usqful and
intel-estin truths. As s subsequent book 1 have
introduce& “ De Viris illm-tribus urbis Romae,”
which, in point of Latinity, style and authenti-city,
appea‘rs to my view superior to those Roman wri-
ters to whom it is now used as s substitute. ‘⁶ Nar-
rationes Excerptae,” as fai· as· my exsmination has
extended. appears to merirmuch, and will have its
place in the course of instruction.

The nestness ud purity of the Latin, which by no
means ohamterize the Selectae ὲ Veteri, now
commonly usedz the brief and simple structure of
the sentenoes ’ς the proper omission of appendices,
, vocabulavies‚ translations, &c- which, inst-ead of
facilitating the progr-eu of boys, only chet-ish a dis,
