THE 'CONCLUSION. · l

AFTER the death of Alexander, his ge- l
nerals divide against. one‘ another, not consid· '
ering that each should take his portion of the ⁷
spoil- Alexander did not designate any suc· ἒ
cessor3 he lest a son under age, a wife in ·
pregnancy, ‚and a natural brother of a feeble
and timid character, all of whom, even to
Olympias his mother, were exterminated.
In· short, after twenty-three years bloody wau-S,
the empire of Alexander was divided into four
great monarchies, to wit, Egypt,.·Macedonia,

. Syri-a and Thrace, which last was 'soon after

¹ subdivided into several little states.

In the space of abo'ut two hundred andfifty
years these states were successively ruined
by a power whom Greece and Asia were
then far from fearing and they became at last
nothing more than mere provinces of the Ro-
man Republic. ’ -

Thatpart of Syria which lay beyond the Eu<-
phrates was the only region which did not sus-
fer the general invasion. 1t forms a separate
kingdom under the name of Parthia.
